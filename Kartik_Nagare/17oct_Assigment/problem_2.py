# Problem 2: Shopping Cart
# Write a program to simulate a shopping cart system. The program should:
# Use a list to store the items added to the cart. Each item is represented by a tuple containing the item name, quantity, and price.
# Allow the user to add items to the cart, remove items, and display the current contents of the cart.
# After adding items, calculate and display the total price of the cart.
# Apply a discount using if-elif conditions:
# 10% off if the total price is above $100.
# 5% off if the total price is between $50 and $100.
# No discount if the total price is below $50
